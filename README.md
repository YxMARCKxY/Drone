### THE FIRST STEP FOR CREATE THIS DRONE IS...
##### Obviously buy the necesary things.ðŸ’¸ for have what to work with 
```
And the necesary things are the next:
1.-Frame
2.-Arduino-uno
3.-Brushless engines
4.-Controllers ESC
5.-A lot of plastic straps
```
#### Sensors:
```
The sensors are a fundamental part for a drone because, without they the drone wasnÂ´t be 
controllable in addition of add a bit of IA (artificial inteligence) for the drone can take 
decisions for itself and help to you with the flight to be a little bit more satisfactory ðŸ¤© 
of what is already...
```
**In this case i use only two sensor even though many more can be added**
```
A  barometric presure sensor for example the "BMP180" which i use in this project
                                        And
A gyroscope and accelerometer sensor form example the "MPU6050" ehich i use in this project
```
