### THE FIRST STEP FOR CREATE THIS DRONE IS...
##### Obviously buy the necesary things.üí∏ for have what to work with 
##### And the necesary things are the next:

- x1 [Frame](https://github.com/YxMARCKxY/Drone/blob/master/images/FRAME.png)
- x1 [Arduino-uno](https://github.com/YxMARCKxY/Drone/blob/master/images/ARDUINO%20UNO.jpg)
- x4 [Brushless engines](https://github.com/YxMARCKxY/Drone/blob/master/images/BRUSHLESS%20ENGINE.jpg)
- x4 [Controllers ESC](https://github.com/YxMARCKxY/Drone/blob/master/images/ESC%20CONTROLLER.png)
- A lot of plastic straps
- x4 [Proppellers for each engine](https://github.com/YxMARCKxY/Drone/blob/master/images/PROPPELLERS.jpg)
- x1 [A distribution energy board](https://github.com/YxMARCKxY/Drone/blob/master/images/DISTRIBUTION%20ENERGY%20BOARD.jpg)
- Wires type dupont (30 of the each type)
- 1 meter of heat shrinkable (4mm)
- Cautin and 2 meters of tin


### THE SECOND STEP FOR CREATE THIS DRONE IS...
##### Buy the necesary sensors for can make flightüõ©Ô∏è this drone 
#### Sensors:
```
The sensors are a fundamental part for a drone because, without they the drone wasn¬¥t be 
controllable in addition of add a bit of IA (artificial inteligence) for the drone can take 
decisions for itself and help to you with the flight to be a little bit more satisfactory ü§© 
of what is already...
```
**In this case I use only two sensor even though many more can be added**
- A  barometric presure sensor for example the ["BMP180"](/images/BMP180.jpg) which i use in this project
- A gyroscope and accelerometer sensor form example the ["MPU6050"](/images/MPU6050.jpg) Which I use in this project

### THE THIRD STEP FOR CREATE THIS DRONE IS...

Here I explain for what I use each of the things that a mentioned before, more up:

### The frame 
```
Obviously for put all the components, mainly for give a structure to all the components and the things more importants about 
it is that all the weight should be extremly centered for make that the drone flight with more ease and due that the components 
stay very tight in the frame with the original structure I modified a little bit it structure putting the arduino uno and the
sensors in the part more up possible and the middle part the rc receptor togheter with the distribution board and finally in the 
part lower I decided put the batterys and in the corners each of the engines but before of arrive to the corner of each engines 
in this section I put the esc controllers for each engine.
```
#### And finally remained so...
